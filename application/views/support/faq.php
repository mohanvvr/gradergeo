        <ul class="faq_li">
        	<li>Your scanner must have an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) with the capacity to handle as many sheets as the number of students in your largest class. Most consumer and basic office multi-function printer-scanners have ADF capacities ranging from 15 to 35 sheets.</li>
            <li>You scanner must be compatible with your computer operating system.</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>Note : Many office supply stores will allow you to return your scanner within 14 days of purchase, with receipt. Check with your store when purchasing your scanner.<p>

        <p>The student's response must match the key for the answer to receive credit.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Weâ€™ve tested GraderJoe on PCs and Macs using Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers. However, because GraderJoe is web-based, it should work with any type of computer and browser. If you have problems with a specific setup, please let us know. (<a href="#top" class="textlink2">back to questions</a>)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Unlike some other systems, GraderJoe uses an optical method to grade tests. This allows for any pencil or pen to be used as long as the mark is dark. However, if there are stray marks on an answer sheet, GraderJoe may not be able to grade it. (<a href="#top" class="textlink2">back to questions</a>)</p>
